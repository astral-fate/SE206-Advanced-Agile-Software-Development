Provide a brief example for each.", answer: ` <p><strong>a) The Four Core Values of the Agile Manifesto:</strong></p> <p>The Agile Manifesto proposes that while there is value in the items on the right, Agile methodologies value the items on the left more:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Individuals and interactions over Processes and Tools:</strong> This value emphasizes that people are the most important factor in software development. Effective communication and collaboration among team members are more crucial for success than rigid processes or specific tools. While processes and tools can be helpful, they should support the team, not dictate their work in a way that hinders interaction.</li> <li><strong>Working Product over Comprehensive Documentation:</strong> Agile prioritizes delivering functional software that provides value to the customer over spending excessive time creating extensive documentation. Documentation is still created, but it's kept lean and purposeful, focusing on what's necessary rather than producing exhaustive documents that may quickly become outdated.</li> <li><strong>Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation:</strong> This value stresses the importance of a continuous partnership with the customer throughout the development lifecycle. Instead of relying solely on an initial contract and negotiating every change, Agile encourages ongoing collaboration to ensure the product meets the customer's evolving needs and to build trust.</li> <li><strong>Responding to change over Following a plan:</strong> Agile methodologies acknowledge that requirements are likely to change during a project. Therefore, they value the ability to adapt and respond to these changes quickly and efficiently, rather than strictly adhering to an initial, potentially outdated, plan. While planning is essential, the plan should be flexible.</li> </ol> <p><strong>b) Three Agile Principles and their Guidance:</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Principle 1: "Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Guidance:</strong> This principle directs the team to focus on delivering working software in frequent, small increments that provide tangible value to the customer from an early stage. It shifts the focus from completing all features at once to providing a steady stream of useful functionality.</li> <li><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of waiting six months to deliver a complete application, an Agile team might deliver a core feature set within the first month, allowing the customer to use it and provide feedback, which then informs subsequent development.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Principle 2: "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Guidance:</strong> This principle encourages teams to be flexible and view changes in requirements not as disruptions, but as opportunities to deliver a more valuable product. It means building processes that can accommodate changes without significant rework or delays.</li> <li><strong>Example:</strong> If a customer realizes halfway through a project that a new market trend requires an additional feature, an Agile team would work to incorporate this change into an upcoming iteration, rather than sticking rigidly to the original scope if the change adds significant value.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Principle 7: "Working software is the primary measure of progress."</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Guidance:</strong> This principle asserts that the most meaningful way to track progress is by the amount of functional, tested software delivered. It de-emphasizes metrics like percentage of tasks completed or lines of code written if they don't translate to usable product features.</li> <li><strong>Example:</strong> At the end of an iteration (e.g., a two-week sprint), the team demonstrates the new, working features they've completed. This tangible output is how progress is assessed by both the team and the stakeholders, not just a status report indicating tasks are "in progress."</li> </ul> </li> </ol> ` }, { id: "essayQ2", question: "<strong>Question 2:</strong><br>Extreme Programming (XP) and Scrum are two prominent Agile methodologies.<br>a) Compare and contrast XP and Scrum, highlighting at least three key differences in their practices or focus.<br>b) Describe three distinct roles within an XP team and three distinct roles within a Scrum team, outlining their primary responsibilities.", answer: ` <p><strong>a) Comparison and Contrast of XP and Scrum:</strong></p> <p>Both XP and Scrum are Agile methodologies that emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. However, they have different focuses and prescribe different sets of practices.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Extreme Programming (XP)</th> <th>Scrum</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Primary Focus</strong></td> <td>Technical excellence and software engineering practices.</td> <td>Project management framework and process optimization.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Iteration Length</strong></td> <td>Typically very short, 1-2 weeks. (Weekly cycle)</td> <td>Typically 2-4 weeks (called Sprints). (30 days)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Prescriptiveness</strong></td> <td>More prescriptive about specific engineering practices (e.g., pair programming, TDD, continuous integration).</td> <td>Less prescriptive about engineering practices, allowing teams to choose their own.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Handling Change</strong></td> <td>Embraces change continuously within iterations.</td> <td>Changes are typically not introduced during a Sprint; backlog refined for next Sprint.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Team Size</strong></td> <td>Designed for small project teams, typically 2-12 members.</td> <td>Suitable for small teams, often less than 10 persons for the dev team.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Documentation</strong></td> <td>Minimal, e.g., User Story Cards, CRC Cards, Visible Wall Graphs.</td> <td>Key artifacts include Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Burndown Charts.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Focus on Engineering Practices:</strong> XP is highly focused on specific software engineering practices like Pair Programming, Test-First Programming, and Continuous Integration. Scrum, on the other hand, provides a framework for managing the development process but doesn't mandate specific engineering techniques.</li> <li><strong>Iteration Management and Change:</strong> XP iterations (often weekly cycles) are more flexible in incorporating changes. Scrum Sprints are typically time-boxed, and the Sprint Backlog is generally kept stable during a Sprint.</li> <li><strong>Roles:</strong> XP roles are often more fluid (e.g., Programmer, Coach). Scrum has very distinct roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team).</li> </ol> <p><strong>b) Roles in XP and Scrum:</strong></p> <p><strong>XP Roles:</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Programmer:</strong> Responsible for writing tests, designing, and coding the software. They also refactor code, identify and estimate tasks and stories.</li> <li><strong>Coach:</strong> Teaches team members about the XP process, intervenes in case of issues, and monitors whether XP practices are being followed.</li> <li><strong>Customer (On-Site Customer):</strong> An integral part of the team who writes user stories and acceptance tests, prioritizes stories, and is readily available to answer questions.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Scrum Roles:</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> Responsible for maximizing the value of the product. They manage and prioritize the Product Backlog and define the vision.</li> <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> A servant-leader for the Scrum Team. Facilitates Scrum events, removes impediments, and coaches the team.</li> <li><strong>Development Team:</strong> A self-organizing, cross-functional group of professionals who deliver a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product.</li> </ol> ` }, { id: "essayQ3", question: "<strong>Question 3:</strong><br>Effort estimation is critical in Agile projects.<br>a) Explain the key components used in calculating User Story Effort in Agile, as per the formula: User Story Effort = Σ (Complexity × ILF × Story Size).<br>b) A project has three user stories with the following details:<br> * Story 1: Complexity=2, ILF=1, Story Size=5<br> * Story 2: Complexity=3, ILF=1.2, Story Size=8<br> * Story 3: Complexity=1, ILF=0.8, Story Size=3<br> Calculate the Total User Story Effort.<br>c) Briefly explain how Project Velocity and Project Time (duration) are subsequently estimated based on User Story Effort.<br>d) What is the Magnitude of Relative Error (MRE), and how is it calculated?
